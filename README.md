# The Providentz - An Irish Ship in Norwegian Waters

![Responsive view mockup](/assets/images/responsive_design.png)
The Providentz is a website built with the aim of presenting all relevant information about an 18th century shipwreck found in Norway.  The site is targeted towards any person with an interest in maritime history or archaeology.  The Providentz will provide any research relating to the shipwreck, as well as any community outreach or projects inspired by the shipwreck.

## UX
### Site Owner Goals
- One of the most important parts of an archaeologist's job is to present available knowledge about finds to the public.  Generally, this is done through academic journals and other publications.  These journals are often difficult to access and require paid subscriptions.  Individual publications can be very expensive.
- There is a push in archaeology to make information more accessible.  This website is meant to increase the reach of the information by providing a public source of information.
### Site User Goals
#### First Time User
- The user is able to find basic information about the ship.
- The user is able to find more detailed background information about the origins of the ship, what happened to it, and what work is being done.
- The user is directed to other links where they can find more information.
#### Return User
-The user can easily find any information that has been updated since their last visit to the site.
### Structure
- The site was originally planned as a multi page website with four separate pages; a home page, Archaeology, Media, and Contact
- Midway through development, the current content made it clear that the site at the moment would be better suited to a single webpage with multiple sections
- The Archaeology section was changed to History and the Contact section was changed to News, which would contain both news items and links to follow along for more information
- As the research on the ship advances, more information will result in a need for splitting the site into multiple pages
### Wireframes
- I planned this site using Balsamiq

## Features
### Existing Features
- Navigation Bar
1. The navigation bar contains the title of the page on the left and the navigation links to the right when viewed on a desktop.  When viewed on a mobile device, the links appear below the title.
2. The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the website.
3. As the site is a single page site, this allows the user to be able to easily jump from one section to another without having to scroll back to the top of the page or use the 'back' button in the browser.
- The landing page image
1. The image chosen provides a quick glimpse at some of the artefacts found on the shipwreck to create interest in the find.
2. A smaller version of the image is used for mobile devices to reduce load time and provide a more suitable size of photo for a smaller screen.
3. A brief paragraph describes the significance of the wreck.
- History
1. The history of the ship as a working vessel is described. This includes the origin of the ship and the circumstances around its sinking.
2. The history of the ship as a find is then described, including the search, discovery, and verification.
3. All images included can be opened in new tabs for closer viewing.
- Media
1. The links all open in a new tab.
2. The presence of articles from different countries shows the international interest in the project.
- News
1. This is a section to provide information on the most recent project relating to the wreck.
2. A link is provided to take the user to more information about that project.
3. The two main participants in the research of the shipwreck are listed with all social media and homepage links provided.
### Features to Implement
- Once more information becomes available, the goal would be to move to a multi-page site
- A Norwegian version of the website.
- A news archive page for when there are more items.
- A photo lightbox would be a preferrable method of displaying photos once more are made available, as this would allow users to view the images without taking them away from the main page.
