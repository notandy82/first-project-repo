## General Information
- One of the most important parts of an archaeologist's job is to present available knowledge about finds to the public.  Generally, this is done through academic journals and other publications.  These journals are often difficult to access and require paid subscriptions.  Individual publications can be very expensive.
- There is a push in archaeology to make information more accessible.  This website is meant to increase the reach of the information by providing a public source of information.
